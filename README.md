# **About Me**
My name is Sanaa El Messaoudi. I’m a new student, and this is my first semester pursuing an Associate of Applied Science in Data Science. I have some background in IT management from my home country, but that was some time ago, which is why I decided to pursue my studies in the IT field. I’m also a mother to a 3-year-old daughter. It has been challenging for me, as a mom, to attend in-person classes, so I chose hybrid classes. As a second-language student, I’m looking for more opportunities to interact with both instructors and students to improve my communication skills.
